### WSL2    <Icon name="linux" />


[WSL2 Setup/Installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

'Developers can access the power of both Windows and Linux at the same time on a Windows machine. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers install a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Kali, Debian, Arch Linux, etc) and use Linux applications, utilities, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.'

<Aside type="note">Ubuntu is great for Hyperfy v2.</Aside>
