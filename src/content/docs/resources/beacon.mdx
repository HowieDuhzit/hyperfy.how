## Beacon
[Spatial Beacon](https://github.com/zestyxyz/beacon)

### Distributed Spatial Internet Graph Beacon
Adding the beacon will get your spatial web app discovered across a distributed network of spatial internet graphs.

### Current Functionality
As of today, the beacon simply sends some basic metadata about the embedding app (name, description, and URL) to a specified relay endpoint for indexing.


## Relay
[relay.zesty.xyz](https://relay.zesty.xyz/)

'This is a deployment of a Spatial Internet Graph Relay, which helps to catalogue spatial experiences on the web, currently maintained by [Zesty](https://www.zesty.xyz/).'
