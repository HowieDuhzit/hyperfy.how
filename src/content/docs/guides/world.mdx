A unique ID for the current server or client.

### `.isServer`: Boolean

Whether the script is currently executing on the server.

### `.isClient`: Boolean

Whether the script is currently executing on the client.

### `.add(node)`

Adds a node into world-space, outside of the apps local hierarchy.

### `.remove(node)`

### `.attach(node)`

Adds a node into world-space, maintaining its current world transform.

### `.on(event, callback)`

Currently only `enter` and `leave` are available which let you know when a player enters or leaves the world.

### `.off(event, callback)`

Unsubscribes from world events.
