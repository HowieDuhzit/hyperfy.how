[Repo is Here](https://github.com/Innkeeping/theHype)

The Hype is a 'Awesome Hyperfy' community resource for [Hyperfy v2.](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy)

Easily add resources in markdown to the appropriate .md or .mdx file.  If needed, create a new file.  (be sure to start with frontmatter format of all others)

Sidebar and page link will autogenerate on 'reference' section.

'reference' sidebar will be in order based on the .md/.mdx file name.

On 'guides' section, need to add to astro.config.mjs.
