## Is Hyperfy free?

Yes it's free open source.  Once you are ready to share your v2 world with others that can join, the world will need to be [hosted](/hosting/self).  This is the only cost associated, but you can find many ways to do this.  Some even free.


## Where do I get started in v2?

For inspiration, head over to [v2 Sandbox](https://play.hyperfy.xyz/)

When you're ready to make your own, hop in [Quick Start](/quickstart/installation)
