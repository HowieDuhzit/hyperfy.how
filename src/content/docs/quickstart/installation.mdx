### Node

**Node 22.11.0+ (eg via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating))**

```sh frame="none"
nvm install 22.11.0
nvm use 22.11.0

```

## Install

### Main Branch

```sh frame="none"

git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world
cd my-world
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

```

After above, your world is now running in http://localhost:3000/. Open in browser.

When your world is not running (you kill the terminal) you can change the `my-world` to anyname you want for your world.

Just remember next time, you will `cd 'new world name'` then `npm run dev`

<GithubCard owner="hyperfy-xyz" repo="hyperfy"/>

### Dev Branch

To work from the `dev` branch:

<Aside title="Alpha Branch" type="caution">

This branch is development.  So it's most recent, but also continuous alpha.  If new, most likely you want to stick to [main branch](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git) from [install above](/quickstart/installation/#install).

</Aside>


```sh frame="none"
cd my-world
git fetch origin
git checkout -t origin/dev
git pull
```
