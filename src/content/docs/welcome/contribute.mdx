Easily add resources in markdown to the appropriate .md or .mdx file.  If needed, create a new file.  (be sure to start with frontmatter format of all others)

Sidebar and page link will autogenerate on 'resources' section.

'resources' sidebar will be in order based on the .md/.mdx file name.

On 'guides' and 'brand' sections, need to add to astro.config.mjs. Order is based on astro.config.mjs.
